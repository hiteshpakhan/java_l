# types of Data type:

* Static & dynamic datastructure
* linier & non-linear ds
* primitive & non-primative ds
* homogeneous and non-homogeneous ds

#

* static ds :

        if we store data upto fix number
        Ex: array

* dynamic ds:

        it allows the programmer to changes its size duering its execution
        Ex: link list, graph, tree

* linear ds: 

        data is store in consecutive memory location 
        Ex: array, stack, queue

* non-linear ds:

        data is store in non-consecutive memory location
        Ex: tree, graph

* primitive ds:

        these are basic d.s. that can directly operate upon by machine instruction
        Ex: integer, floating point no, String, character 

* non-primitive ds:

        these are complicated ds emphasizing on the structuring of a group of homogeneous or hetrogeneous data items
        Ex: array list tree graph 

* Homogeneous ds:

        data elements are of same type
        Ex: array

* non-Homogeneous ds:

        data elements may or not of same type
        Ex: link list
